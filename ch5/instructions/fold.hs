-- The output array has shape  sh ; that is, one dimension fewer than the input array.

-- The function argument used with foldP must be associative. That is,
-- the function f must satisfy  f x (f y z) == f (f x y) z. This is
-- because unlike foldS, foldP doesnâ€™t necessarily fold the function over
-- the array elements in strict left-to-right order; it folds different parts
-- of the array in parallel and then combines the results from those parts
-- using the folding function.
